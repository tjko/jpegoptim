Jpegoptim v1.5.6beta - Copyright (C)  Timo Kokkonen, 1996-2025. All Rights Reserved.


REQUIREMENTS
	Independent JPEG Group's jpeg library (libjpeg) version 6b or later.
	(Alternatively should also work with libjpeg-turbo or mozjpeg)


TESTED PLATFORMS

	tar file, make necessary changes to the Makefile,  and then
        compile the program. You may wanna do something like this:

		tar xzvf jpegoptim-1.5.6.tar.gz
		cd jpegoptim-1.5.6
		./configure
		make
		make strip
		make install
