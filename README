Jpegoptim v1.4.1 - Copyright (c)  Timo Kokkonen, 1996-2014. All Rights Reserved.

	Linux
	Solaris 
	Darwin/OS X j
	Windows (should now compile with minimal effort...)


INSTALLATION

	tar file, make necessary changes to the Makefile,  and then 
        compile the program. You may wanna do something like this:

		zcat jpegoptim-1.4.1.tar.gz | tar xf -
		cd jpegoptim-1.4.1
		./configure
		make
		make strip
		make install


HISTORY
        v1.4.1 - fix --stdin option (assume -f when reading from stdin),
		 workaround to bug in libjpeg-turboi (v1.3.1) triggered
		 when option -V or --version was used,
                 other minor fixes
	v1.4.0 - use memory (instead of temporary files) during optimization,
		 support for reading input from stdin (and sending output to
                 stdout), 
		 report also libjpeg version when --version option used,
		 new option --strip-none to preserve "all" markers,
		 other minor fixes & cleanup
	v1.3.1 - XMP marker support and new --csv option (by Matteo Croce),
		 use DESTDIR instead of INSTALL_ROOT (by Samuli Suominen),
		 changes to make compiling under Win32 and Win64
		 easier (thanks to Javier Gutiérrez),
                 preserve permissions of files being optimized,
                 skip symlinks (and other special files),
                 other minor fixes
        v1.3.0 - support for progressive jpegs added (fixes long standing
                 "bug" of progressive jpegs becoming non-progressive during
                 optimization), 
                 new options --all-normal & --all-progressive for
                 converting jpegs to non-progressive & progressive,
                 new -S / --size option to set target size for output
                 file (enables lossy optimization),
		 updated GPL/Copyrights language (thanks to Nicolas Vieville)
	v1.2.5 - safer temp file handling (if mkstemps() available),
		 patch to make "quiet mode" (-q) be quiet by Mathieu Malaterre
	v1.2.4 - new -T / --threshold option by Matteo Croce,
		 minor fixes (potential memory leaks),
		 merged some patches from Debian jpegoptim package (1.2.3-2)
	v1.2.3 - IPTC marker support by Dustin Ward,
		 ICC profile support by Dwight Kelly,
		 minor fixes 
	v1.2.2 - Now Exif and COM markers are not discarded
                 (all other markers are discarded as before).
	         New options --strip-all, --strip-exif, and --strip-com
	         added for controlling what markers to strip.
	v1.2.1 - fixed buggy temp file handling
	v1.2.0 - Added new options --overwrite and --preserve.
		 GNU autoconf support added, also.
