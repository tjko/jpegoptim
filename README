		 certain jpeg files
        v1.4.2 - add option -P, --preserve-perms,
                 some minor fixes
        v1.4.1 - fix --stdin option (assume -f when reading from stdin),

		 when option -V or --version was used,
                 other minor fixes
	v1.4.0 - use memory (instead of temporary files) during optimization,
		 support for reading input from stdin (and sending output to
                 stdout), 
		 report also libjpeg version when --version option used,
		 new option --strip-none to preserve "all" markers,
		 other minor fixes & cleanup
	v1.3.1 - XMP marker support and new --csv option (by Matteo Croce),

                 new options --all-normal & --all-progressive for
                 converting jpegs to non-progressive & progressive,
                 new -S / --size option to set target size for output
                 file (enables lossy optimization),
