Jpegoptim v1.5.5 - Copyright (C)  Timo Kokkonen, 1996-2023. All Rights Reserved.


REQUIREMENTS
	Independent JPEG Group's jpeg library (libjpeg) version 6b or later.
	(Alternatively should also work with libjpeg-turbo or mozjpeg)


TESTED PLATFORMS
	Linux
	MacOS
	Windows (setargv.obj "link option" is needed for wildcards expansion to work)


INSTALLATION
	Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
	tar file, make necessary changes to the Makefile,  and then
        compile the program. You may wanna do something like this:

		tar xzvf jpegoptim-1.5.5.tar.gz
		cd jpegoptim-1.5.5
		./configure
		make
		make strip
		make install
