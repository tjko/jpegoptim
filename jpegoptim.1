.SH NAME 
jpegoptim \- utility to optimize/compress JPEG/JFIF files.


.SH SYNOPSIS 
.B jpegoptim
[ 
.B options 
] [ 
.B filenames 
] 

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.I jpegoptim
is used to optimize/compress jpeg files. Program supports lossless
optimization, which is based on optimizing the Huffman tables. And
so called "lossy" optimization where in addition to optimizing Huffman
tables user can specify upperlimit for image quality.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options may be either the traditional POSIX one letter options, or the
GNU style long options.  POSIX style options start with a single
``\-'', while GNU long options start with ``\-\^\-''.

Options offered by
.I jpegoptim
are the following:
.TP 0.6i
.B -d<path>, --dest=<path>
Sets alternative destination directory where to save optimized files
(default is to overwrite the originals). Please note that unchanged files
won't be added to the destination directory. This means if the source
file can't be compressed, no file will be created in the destination path.
.TP 0.6i
.B -f, --force
Force optimization, even if the result would be larger than the original
file.
.TP 0.6i
.B -h, --help
Displays short usage information and exits.
.TP 0.6i
.B -m<quality>, --max=<quality>
Sets the maximum image quality factor (disables lossless optimization
mode, which is by default enabled). This option will reduce quality
of those source files that were saved using higher quality setting. 
While files
that already have lower quality setting will be compressed using the
lossless optimization method.

Valid values for quality parameter are: 0 - 100
.TP 0.6i
.B -n, --noaction
Don't really optimize files, just print results.
.TP 0.6i
.B -S<size>, --size=<size>
Try to optimize file to given size (disables lossless
optimization mode). Target size is specified either in
kilobytes (1 - n) or as percentage (1% - 99%) of the original file size.
.TP 0.6i
.B -T<threshold>, --threshold=<threshold>
Keep the file unchanged if the compression gain is lower than the threshold (%).

Valid values for threshold are: 0 - 100
.TP 0.6i
.B -o, --overwrite
Overwrite target file even if it exists (when using -d option).
.TP 0.6i
.B -p, --preserve
Preserve file modification times.
.TP 0.6i
.B -q, --quiet
Quiet mode.
.TP 0.6i
.B -t, --totals
Print totals after processing all files.
.TP 0.6i
.B -v, --verbose
Enables verbose mode (positively chatty).

.TP 0.6i
.B --all-normal
Force all output files to be non-progressive. Can be used to convert
all input files to progressive JPEGs when used with --force option.
.TP 0.6i
.B --all-progressive
Force all output files to be progressive. Can be used to convert 
all input files to normal (non-progressive) JPEGs when used with --force option.

.TP 0.6i
.B --strip-all
Strip all (Comment & Exif) markers from output file. (NOTE! by default
only Comment & Exif markers are kept, everything else is discarded)
.TP 0.6i
.B --strip-com
Strip Comment (COM) markers from output file.
.TP 0.6i
.B --strip-exif
Strip EXIF markers from output file.
.TP 0.6i
.B --strip-iptc
Strip IPTC markers from output file.
.TP 0.6i
.B --strip-icc
Strip ICC profiles from output file.




.SH BUGS
When using --size option, resulting file is not always exactly the
requested size. Workaround is to re-run jpegoptim on the same file again
which often will result file closer to target size.
