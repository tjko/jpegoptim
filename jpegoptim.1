.SH NAME 
jpegoptim \- utility to optimize/compress JPEG/JFIF files.


.SH SYNOPSIS 
.B jpegoptim
[ 
.B options 
] [ 
.B filenames 
] 

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.I jpegoptim
is used to optimize/compress jpeg files. Program supports lossless
optimization, which is based on optimizing the Huffman tables. And
so called "lossy" optimization where in addtition to optimizing Huffman
tables user can specify upperlimit for image quality.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options may be either the traditional POSIX one letter options, or the
GNU style long options.  POSIX style options start with a single
``\-'', while GNU long options start with ``\-\^\-''.

Options offered by
.I jpegoptim
are the following:
.TP 0.6i
.B -d<path>, --dest=<path>
Sets alternative destination directory where to save optimized files
(default is to overwrite the originals).
.TP 0.6i
.B -f, --force
Force optimization, even if the result would be larger than the original
file.
.TP 0.6i
.B -h, --help
Displays short usage information and exits.
.TP 0.6i
.B -m[0..100], --max=[0..100]
Sets the maximum image quality factor (disables lossless optimization
mode, which is by default enabled). This option will reduce quality
of those source files that were saved using higher quality setting. 
While files
that already have lower quality setting will be compressed using the
lossless optimization method.
.TP 0.6i
.B -n, --noaction
Don't really optimize files, just print results.
.TP 0.6i
.B -o, --overwrite
Overwrite target file even if it exists (when using -d option).
.TP 0.6i
.B -p, --preserve
Preserve file modification times.
.TP 0.6i
.B -q, --quiet
Quiet mode.
.TP 0.6i
.B -t, --totals
Print totals after processing all files.
.TP 0.6i
.B -v, --verbose
Enables verbose mode (positively chatty).

.TP 0.6i
.B --strip-all
Strip all (Comment & Exif) markers from output file. (NOTE! by default
only Comment & Exif markers are kept, everything else is discarded)
.TP 0.6i
.B --strip-com
Strip Comment (COM) markers from output file.
.TP 0.6i
.B --strip-exif
Strip EXIF markers from output file.




.SH BUGS
When optimizing progressive jpeg, result will be a normal jpeg.
